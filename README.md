# Heart Disease Prediction Application

## Description
The **Heart Disease Prediction Application** is a web-based tool that predicts the risk of heart disease based on user-provided health metrics. This application leverages Machine Learning algorithms to analyze input data and provide accurate predictions. In addition, it offers several features like locating nearby hospitals, accessing articles on heart health, and answering health-related questions to enhance user awareness.

## Features
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Input health metrics to predict whether you are at risk of heart disease.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: An interactive UI built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Machine Learning**: Backend prediction system using Flask and trained machine learning models.
- **Nearby Hospitals**: Provides a list of nearby hospitals for users requiring immediate medical assistance.
- **Educational Articles**: Access a blog section with curated articles on heart health and preventive care.
- **Interactive Questions**: Answer health-related questions to improve awareness and knowledge about heart health.

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used
- Logistic Regression (Scikit-learn)
- Naive Bayes (Scikit-learn)
- Support Vector Machine (Linear) (Scikit-learn)
- K-Nearest Neighbours (Scikit-learn)
- Decision Tree (Scikit-learn)
- Random Forest (Scikit-learn)
- XGBoost (Scikit-learn)
- Neural Network

**Accuracy Achieved**: 95% (Random Forest)

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Machine Learning**: Trained models for prediction using Python libraries
